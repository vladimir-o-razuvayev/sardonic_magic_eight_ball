# Sardonic Magic Eight Ball
This is a basic implementation of a magical eight ball in Rust that provides sardonic responses

The program uses a vector of sardonic responses, and each time the user asks a question, it selects a random response from the vector to provide as the "answer" from the magical eight ball. The user can ask multiple questions by continuing to input "y" when prompted.

Generated on https://chat.openai.com/chat by me with the prompt "write a rust script implementing a magical eight ball, but have the possible answers be more sardonic"
